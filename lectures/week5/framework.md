## Inversion of Control

### A software [library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_\(computing\)) is a collection software tools that can be utilized by another program to perform an application-specific task.


### It is like a palette of paint available to a painter: the painter can employ any colors they want in whichever way they wish, they are in control.


### A [framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) inverts this [control](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3057818/1798342), it is more like painting by numbers, the framework is in control, it's up to the painter to do a good job of following the rules.
