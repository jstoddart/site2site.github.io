## Microcontroller vs Microprocessor

### Reconfiguring hardware (programmable gate array) vs. providing instructions according to a computer architecture (instruction set)

### RISC, x86, ARM


## Operating system

### Unix, Mac OSX, Windows, Linux

### API

### Threads


## Application layer

### Machine code

### Compiler vs interpreter


## JavaScript Demo

### Runtime environment (provides I/O)

### Browser

### REPL (console)

### Control flow (if/for)

### Objects (arrays)

### new operator (constructor)

### this

### Methods (dot notation)

### Prototype

### Asynchronous

### Callbacks

### Event listeners


## Node.js

>	Node.js is a software platform that is used to build scalable network (especially server-side) applications. Node.js utilizes JavaScript as its scripting language, and achieves high throughput via non-blocking I/O and a single-threaded event loop.

### Runtime for javascript

### Javascript on the server

### Provides I/O, single-threaded non-blocking, evented runtime

## Terminal / Command Prompt

### REPL

### Execute demo in node

Frameworks (inverted control, Johnny Five)


















## Inversion of Control

### A software [library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_\(computing\)) is a collection software tools that can be utilized by another program to perform an application-specific task.


### It is like a palette of paint available to a painter: the painter can employ any colors they want in whichever way they wish, they are in control.


### A [framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) inverts this [control](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3057818/1798342), it is more like painting by numbers, the framework is in control, it's up to the painter to do a good job of following the rules.
