## Due Date
The assignment for each PERSON (not group), is to do the following - all are due by 9am Monday, Sept 30, unless otherwise noted.


## Catching up

1.	If you haven't finished any of the previous assignments, do so IMMEDIATELY. This includes installing and setting up software, and running the Arduino tutorial from Week 3 (http://site2site.github.io/lectures/week3/example.html) - set up office hours with Troy if you're still having trouble.

2.	FINISH the Javascript tutorial on Code Academy by Monday if you haven't already. This is non-negotiable, we will be checking everyone on Monday and your grade will be deducted if you have not finished 100%.


## Post-Review

1.	Read the CRITIQUE.md file in your group repo very carefully - this will describe how we see your group going forward.

2.	Add a new section to the README.md file in your group repo with ONE PARAGRAPH describing your takeaway - i.e. what you learned - from the review on Sept 26 about your group proposal.

3. _NOTE_: If you have switched groups, you have to do #1 and #2 above for your previous group and your new group (#2 should be what you learned about the proposal made by your new group).

4. Email Chris and Troy directly if you have thoughts, questions, or concerns about the new structure of the class and our comments in the CRITIQUE.md file for your group.


## New Structure

Following the conversation yesterday, we want to structure the Session A projects around 2 poles: objects and fields. This is how we see it:


- Object-Oriented Office is an object project in which a finite number of predefined and specifically designed or augmented objects provide specific information.

- Studio Analytics and Studio-X Press are both field projects that will need to collect information from a grid of sensors that cover the entire space.

- Shareveillance is an isolated field (ie. not the whole space, but only a part of it) in which an evolving list of unique objects can be identified, so it is somewhere between objects and field.

- The Voice of Studio-X group is going out of town for 2 weeks, so they will partner with the Studio Analytics group in dealing with the distribution of sound through speakers later in the semester.


There will be more explained in your CRITIQUE.md file in your repos.


## New Group Organization

Also, we would like to restructure the groups as follows:

1. Dina will join The Voice of Studio-X; Yifeng will join Studio Analytics.
2. Studio Analytics will partner with Studio-X Press to design a grid of controllers (Raspberry Pis and Arduinos) that can plug into multiple sensors (microphones, thermistors, photoresistors, etc), but will design other parts of your projects independently.


## Tasks

Over the weekend, we will make a roadmap for each group to achieve the necessary technical elements in the next 2 weeks. This will be in the form of a task list in the issues section of your group repo. Each person will sign up for different tasks. Some groups will require the same technology, so one person may be doing a task for "their group", but their output will also be used by another. It is up to Chris and I to organize this so that everything adds up. You will have much autonomy to choose your areas of contribution, but may be asked to do specific things that we think you would be good at as well.


## Making Stuff & Office Hours

Next week every group needs to set up office hours with Troy on Tuesday, as we did last week. Troy will set up the initial skeleton of technology for each group, and we will discuss it during this meeting. After that, you will be in production mode.


## Hackathon

The hackathon will happen on Oct 12, from about 10am-7pm. We hope as many of you can join as possible. We will send separate information on this later, but please mark your calendars.
